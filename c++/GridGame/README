# Project Title: Grid Game

# Description:
This is a simple text based game. It's a little bit like Mine Sweeper if you have ever played that before. 

# Goals: 
The player starts in block 1 in a 10 by 10 game grid. Their goal is to traverse the grid and reach the bottom right block (#100).
The player can only choose to move right or down. Each block has a hidden value or either a 0 or 1. If the player chooses to move
where the underlying game grid contains a 0, then they are safe. Traveling over a 1 however, will result a loss!. 

That's it! All the player must do is traverse the grid -- starting from block 1 and get to block 100.

Give it a try! Simply download the GridGame.h header file and the GridGameDriver.cpp -- compile and go!
